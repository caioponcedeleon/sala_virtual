**S@la Virtual** (virtual classroom in Portuguese) is an interactive virtual classroom platform designed to make online learning **engaging, dynamic, and fun!**  

It allows teachers to create and control **live interactive slide presentations** that students can follow and participate in **real-time**.  

This project was created during the **COVID-19 pandemic** to transform passive virtual classes into **lively, interactive learning environments**, enabling students to engage directly with class content and complete exercises in real-time—while allowing teachers to monitor and correct their mistakes live. The system is currently only available in Portuguese (a multi-language update is coming).
